Description: When using R you often need to have installed the correct version, 
    have the correct packages and dependencies, and access to the correct data 
    and API keys. This can be difficult to convey to beginners or require 
    intimidating long lists of prerequisites. So we have condensed the whole 
    process down into a single one-line command that is easy to use.
