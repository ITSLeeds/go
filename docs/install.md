Installing R and R Studio
================

### What is R?

R is a programming language and free software environment for
statistical computing and graphics. R has many capabilities for
analysing data and writing software, but in this context, its ability to
produce and analyse spatial data and maps is most relevant.

You can find a lot more information about R at:

  - <https://www.r-project.org/>
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)>

To get started with R, see An Introduction to R
[online](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)
or from within R by running `help.start()`, or introductory tutorials
such as DataCampâ€™s
[free](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
Introduction to R course.

### What is an R package?

An R package is a small piece of software that extends the basic
capabilities of R. It is a bit like how a new phone can do some things
out of the box (make phone calls, send email) but you have to install
apps to add extra abilities.
